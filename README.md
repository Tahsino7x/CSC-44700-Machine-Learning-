# CSC-44700-Machine-Learning-

Hey everyone! 
My name is Tahsin Parvez, I'm majoring in computer science and I'm a senior aiming to graduate after the Fall 2023 semester. As a child I was always fascinated by computers, but I'm only learning now how much programming goes on behind the scenes! I should've went into computer engineering. Oh well. I grew particular interest in Machine Learning because the name itself sounds pretty crazy. A machine, and its learning? How is that possible? Wow! I'm ecstatic to be taking this class with Professor Grimmelman this semester. Thanks!
